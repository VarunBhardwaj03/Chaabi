# Chaabi

All the steps have been outlined in the notebook itself, kindly run all the cells and in the last cell you can specify your query and the LLM+RAG model will generate appropriate answers using the vectorised custom DB. Also, one needs their own Pinecone authorisation key and Hugging Face authorisation key for using this model and storing it in the database. I have attached the links for setting up everything in the notebook itself.

# Future Work

The model has to be hosted on a web server.
